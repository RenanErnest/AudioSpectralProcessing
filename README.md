# AudioSpectralProcessing
A Sonic Computing class project to practice some core concepts of audio processing like wave editing, Fourier transform, spectrogram analysis, pass filters, IO, etc.
In summary this project is reading a .wav file, plotting its wave and frequencies obtained by a Fourier transform, doing a bandpass filter and getting the filtered audio back to wave format (amplitude vs time) and saving the new filtered .wav file.
